Soler-Camargo et al, 2020. The role of in silico predicted pseudogenes in the genomic plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex


INPUT file:

1 - The cds faa CURATED files generated from Multifasta_curation.py algorithm.

Put the file in a directory with the Primer_generator.py algorithm and run the following comand:

python3 Primer_generator.py


OUTPUT files:

1 - The "nr_primer_database.txt" file, that contains a non-redundant database of the 15 first amino acid primer sequences that represents all pseudogenes analyzed.


NOTES:

- You may run this algorithm for multiples files at once.
