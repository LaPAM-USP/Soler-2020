Soler-Camargo et al, 2020. The role of in silico predicted pseudogenes in the genomic plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex


INPUT files:

1 - The genomic fna files tha contains de DNA sequence of each bacterial strain.

Put the files in a directory with the RD_finder.py algorithm and run the following comand:

python3 RD_finder.py
And then, type the forward primer sequence and the reverse primer sequence when solicited.


OUTPUT files:

1 - The "PCR_product_sizes.txt" file, that contains a list of product sizes of in silico PCR of all analyzed genomes.

NOTES:

- You may run this algorithm for all analyzed genomes at once.

- The algorithm accepts completes and incompletes (drafts) genomes.
